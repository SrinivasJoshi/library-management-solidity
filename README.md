## Future scope for this project 
* Use ZK technology to enhance privacy.
* Store book data in a database and perform computations only on the blockchain.
* Invest staked tokens (DAI) to obtain a fair return and share a portion of the interest with the librarian as an incentive.
* Allow borrowing of multiple books at the same time.
* Stake different amounts of DAI on the basis of price of the book.
* Implement a penalty for late book returns.
* Add a function in the smart contract to enable the librarian to remove books.
